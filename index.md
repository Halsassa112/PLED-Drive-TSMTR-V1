## 🔭 Overview
The PLED-Drive is a novel photonic propulsion concept based on the 
Triple-Stage Managed Toroidal Resonator (TSMTR-V1). It aims to achieve
high photon lifetime extension, controlled-loss coupling, and directionally
vectorized photon thrust using a compact toroidal resonator system.

This site serves as the public technical reference for the architecture,
concept, equations, figures, and associated research.
