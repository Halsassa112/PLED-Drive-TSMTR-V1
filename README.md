A Triple-Stage Managed Toroidal Resonator Architecture for Vectorized Photonic Propulsion

Author: Harrison Saavedra
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17851135

🔭 Overview

The PLED-Drive is a novel photonic propulsion concept based on a
Triple-Stage Managed Toroidal Resonator (TSMTR-V1) featuring:

Extended photon lifetime (τ_eff)

High-Q toroidal geometry

Controlled-Loss Coupling Zone (CLCZ)

Photon Recycling Mirror (PRM)

Internal active gain ring

Solar-compatible injection

Vectorized photonic thrust

This repository contains documentation, conceptual diagrams, architecture descriptions, and ongoing theoretical refinements of the system.

🚀 Core Idea

The PLED-Drive enhances photon momentum transfer by extending the effective photon lifetime through:

Primary Toroidal Resonance

Photon Leakage Control & Re-injection

Directional Out-Coupling for Thrust

By deliberately engineering micro-discontinuities and recycling escaped photons, the system increases circulating optical power from minimal input, enabling propellant-free thrust.

🌀 Key Components

TSMTR-V1 High-Q Toroidal Resonator

Internal Yb/YAG-based Active Gain Ring

Controlled-Loss Coupling Zone (CLCZ)

Photon Recycling Mirror (PRM)

Triple-Stage Managed Resonant Cycle (TCMS)

Solar-compatible spectral injection

🧮 Core Equations

Effective quality factor:

Q = ω τ_eff


Photon thrust:

F = P_out / c
F_reflect = 2 P_out / c


Circulating power enhancement:

P_circ ≈ P_in · Q / π
